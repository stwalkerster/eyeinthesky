## EyeInTheSky IRC Bot

This is a stalk bot for edits on Wikipedia.

It uses the RC IRC feed on irc.wikimedia.org to look for edits, and reports stalked edits in ##eyeinthesky on irc.freenode.net

## Versions

Stable versions are of the form 1.EVEN.*, unstable/test versions are of the form 1.ODD. I strongly recommend you download the highest 1.EVEN.* version, as that will most likely serve you best.
